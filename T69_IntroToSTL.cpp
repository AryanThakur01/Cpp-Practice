---->STL : Standard template library

Library of what?
->Generic Classes and functions

Why use STL? : Reusing well tested Components
             : Time Savings!


----->Components of STL:
            - Containers : Stores Data, Use Template Classes
            - Algorithms : Sorting, Searching,,,,, Use Template Functions
            - Iterators  : Object points to an element in a container, .. Handled just like pointers,.. Connects Algorithms with containers
